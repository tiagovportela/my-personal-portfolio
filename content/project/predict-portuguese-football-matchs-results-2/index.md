### 1. Data mining

For met the project goal, i need a dataset with data from matches, player in match, and odds.

#### 1.1 Matchs Data

The web is full with data from footbal games, but only for the top leagues. So i do a research and find that portuguese league [official website](https://ligaportugal.pt) have all games data from 2017 until now. After more research i discover a hidden endopoint that return a resume for league game.

```textile
/pt/liga/jogo/{league_edition}/league_id/{match_week}/{match}/resumo/true
```

With that i buil a simple program that collect data from all leagues from 2017 untill 2022 and save it to a CSV file. Because the response from endpoint is huge i choose the following features:

- Game Date
  
- Game Hour
  
- Home Team
  
- Away Team
  
- Home Team Score
  
- Away Team Score
  
- Home Team Formation
  
- Away Team Formation
  
- Lineups Players
  
- Referee
  
- Assistants
  
- Home Team Penalties
  
- Away Team Penalties
  
- Game stats like faul, shots, red and yellow cards, ball possetion and courners
  

The dataset have the following features:

#### 1.2 Players data.

A good site with football player data is [https://sofifa.com](https://sofifa.com).
